# Plotting and Programming with Python

This repository serves as a home for data files and code associated with the [Plotting and Programming with Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) Software Carpentry lesson.
The intention is for users to be able to start up a binder instance and be able to follow along with the lesson as a backup if there are problems with a local installation.
